This project was developed as part of my internship assessment using modern frontend tools including Vite and Tailwind CSS, with the environment set up using Node.js and npm. To run this project locally, first ensure Node.js is installed on your system, then open the project folder in the terminal and run npm install to install all dependencies. After installation, start the development server using npm run dev and open the provided local host URL (usually http://localhost:5173
) in your browser. For production, you can generate an optimized build using npm run build and preview it using npm run preview. This setup ensures a fast, optimized, and modern development workflow.
